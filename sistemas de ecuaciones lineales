Tema 3 

In these section we will see some examples and definitions of systems of linear equations  with in the class of numerical methods so lets goooo!!!!!!!!!
Jacobi  method
In numerical linear algebra, the Jacobi method  is an iterative algorithm for determining the solutions of a 
strictly diagonally dominant system of linear equations.
Each diagonal element is solved for, and an approximate value is plugged in.
