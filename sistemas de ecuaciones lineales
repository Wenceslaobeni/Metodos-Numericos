Tema 3 

In these section we will see some examples and definitions of systems of linear equations  with in the class of numerical methods so lets goooo!!!!!!!!!

Gaussian elimination method
 the Gaussian elimination method is known as the row reduction algorithm for solving linear equations systems. 
It consists of a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients.
We can also use this method to estimate either of the following: The rank of the given matrix

Gauss Jordan method
The Gauss-Jordan method is similar to the Gaussian elimination process, except that the entries both above and below each pivot are zeroed out. 
After performing Gaussian elimination on a matrix, the result is in row echelon form, while the result after the Gauss-Jordan method is in reduced row echelon form.

Gauss-Seidel method:
In numerical linear algebra, the Gaussâ€“Seidel method, also known as the Liebmann method
or the method of successive displacement, is an iterative method used to solve a system of linear equations.

Jacobi  method:
In numerical linear algebra, the Jacobi method  is an iterative algorithm for determining the solutions of a 
strictly diagonally dominant system of linear equations.
Each diagonal element is solved for, and an approximate value is plugged in.
